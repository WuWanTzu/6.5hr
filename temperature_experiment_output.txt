ðŸ§ª Simulated Temperature Experiment Results:

=== Temperature: 0.0 ===
Solar energy is renewable, reduces electricity bills, and helps combat climate change.

=== Temperature: 0.5 ===
Using solar power can reduce pollution, lower costs, and provide energy independence.

=== Temperature: 1.0 ===
Solar energy is like capturing sunshine in a jarâ€”it powers homes while hugging the Earth.

-------------------------------

ðŸ“˜ Analysis:

With temperature = 0.0, the model gives a factual and concise answer, focusing on concrete benefits.

At temperature = 0.5, the answer becomes slightly more conversational and includes varied phrasing.

With temperature = 1.0, the output is much more creative and metaphorical, demonstrating the randomness and expressiveness added by a higher temperature.

âœ… This simulation demonstrates that temperature significantly influences the style, creativity, and determinism of the language model's response.
